# Discover Vancouver - A Tourism App

## Project Description
This application focuses on community engagement, local exploration, and tourism. It helps users discover Vancouverâ€™s hidden gems of lesser-known foods, events, and recreation activities, encouraging users to explore the whole extent of Vancouver. By providing references like costs, reviews, and transit options, this application will be a city exploration tool that highlights community experiences.

Made using an Oracle Database (no longer in service), JS, NodeJS, and Express.
